Today was a good day.

Today I went for a 4km run with my girlfriend, ate a sausage roll at the bakery, caught up with Andrew who just got back from hiking in Switzerland, finished a movie 'Children of the Sea' which was surreal and awesome! I also had a little nap and have built you (the agentic system creating this blog post).
